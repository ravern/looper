# Looooper
Looooper is a loop machine, which will loop your music automatically,
after you record it. Some examples include Ed Sheeran's live shows
and Beca's final performance in Pitch Perfect 3.

This is just a prototype, so it works, just not very well. There are not
many controls available yet, and the looping is a little off in timing. I
do plan to continue this if I find the time, and perhaps turn it into an
actual website!
